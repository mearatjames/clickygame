# Clicky Game

A pure front end React application in a form of a brain teaser game.

## Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Javascript runtime
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Javascript library for UI
* [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - React App boiler plate
* [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) - React components that implement Google's Material Design

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm i
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
